        "On paper, there are arbitrage profits to be made. However considering the strategy mainly consisted of buying from HitBTC and selling on the other exchanges, we would need to constantly send over ZIL from HitBTC to the respective exchange to sell.  \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "This incurs withdrawal fees of about 216 ZIL as well per transfer (https://withdrawalfees.com/exchanges/hitbtc). Assuming a generous 1% profit each time, this means we need to purchase 21,600 ZIL at a minimum each time to keep funding our operation to breakeven. Considering that purchases from HitBTC and withdrawals to the new exchange to be sold will also have some latency due to the inherent nature of the blockchain and the huge volume required for the strategy to work, the profit margins are razor thin and risks are not worth the effort to get the <1% profits. \r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "To make the strategy work, the overall effect is that you would need a lot of liquidity in ZIL and USDT in the respective accounts to maintain the operations and would be better off just maintaining a momentum based strategy instead."
